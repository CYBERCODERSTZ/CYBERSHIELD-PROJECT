Password Generator Tool Manifest
Target audience: online application users looking to design a user-friendly 
password.
Goal: Create a simple yet effective tool that generates strong and unique 
passwords while incorporating user input for a touch of personalization.
Features:
• User input: Allows users to enter a base string of approximately 5 
characters. 
• Random character mixing: Uses a secure algorithm to shuffle and mix the 
user's input characters with additional random characters to generate a 
16-character password.
• Visual strength indicator: Displays a color-coded or bar-graph 
indicator representing the generated password's strength (e.g., green 
for strong, yellow for moderate, red for weak).
• Optional character pool customization: Allows advanced users to choose 
which character types (uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, symbols) 
are included in the generated password.
• Copy to clipboard button: Enables users to easily copy the generated 
password to their clipboard for pasting into login fields.
Language and tone:
Python or any other general-purpose language
Algorithm implementation: - choose any is best for you to work with
• Secure randomness: Utilize a cryptographically secure random number 
generator (CSPRNG) to ensure randomness and prevent predictability in 
the generated passwords. Popular CSPRNG algorithms include ChaCha20 and 
AES-CTR.
• Character mixing: Implement a shuffling algorithm like the Fisher-Yates 
shuffle to randomly mix the user's input characters with additional 
random characters from the chosen pool.
• Password strength estimation: Use a lightweight password strength 
estimation algorithm like zxcvbn to provide visual feedback on the 
generated password's security.
Additional considerations:
• Security: Implement best practices for secure password generation and 
storage. Avoid storing user input or generated passwords in plain text.
